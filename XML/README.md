# XML Dataset
The XML100 set of instances contains all the 100-customer instances from:

Queiroga, E., Sadykov, R., Uchoa, E., & Vidal, T. (2022).
10,000 optimal CVRP solutions for testing machine learning based heuristics. AAAI’22 Workshop on Machine Learning for Operations Research.

The purpose of these instances is to help training ML models for vehicle routing on a distribution of instances that is more diverse and representative.
The instances are also completed with the Python generation code, therefore permitting generating additional instances if necessary.
It is particularly important to note that all the optimal solutions are provided with these instances.
